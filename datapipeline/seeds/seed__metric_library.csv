OP02,Operations - % of devices managed,"Measures the percentage of active devices (seen within the last 30 days) that are under management and security controls via Okta Device Management. Calculated as (Managed devices / Total active devices) × 100, where managed devices have a management status of 'MANAGED' in Okta. Only includes devices with activity in the last 30 days to exclude decommissioned or inactive devices. Managed devices have enforced security policies, verified configurations, and can be remotely monitored or remediated if compromised. A higher percentage indicates better security posture as unmanaged devices represent significant blind spots - they lack visibility into compliance status, cannot be remotely secured or wiped if lost, and may bypass critical security controls like encryption, patching, or MFA enforcement. This metric is fundamental to zero-trust security models where device trust verification is essential before granting access to sensitive resources.
